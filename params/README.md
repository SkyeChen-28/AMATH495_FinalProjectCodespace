    K_r &: \text{Initial carrying capacity of the richer country's GDP}
    \\
    K_p &: \text{Initial carrying capacity of the poorer country's GDP}
    \\
    f_r \text{ and } f_p &: \text{Both are similar, monotonically non-decreasing functions of time. 
    } \\ &\text{\quad \quad
    To be changed with different experiments}
    \\
    \gamma &: \text{Emission rate of CO$_2$ with respect to GDP}
    \\
    \alpha &: \text{CO$_2$ emission efficiency from GDP due to innovation of the richer country}
